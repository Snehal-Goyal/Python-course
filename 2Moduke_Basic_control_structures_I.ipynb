One of the reasons I got into Python was that my PhD C++ code was so unreadable, dodgily indented and unwieldy, it was easier to rewrite in Python than try and extend it - once I had modification was easy, I could see how everything was laid out, where functions started and ended, before even reading a character.\n","\n","Another thing to note is that you can print with `print`.
